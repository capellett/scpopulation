# scpopulation

## An R-package containing population data for the state of South Carolina.

`scpopulation` is an open-source R-package published as a repository on GitHub. The package stores county level population data and projections from the South Carolina Office of Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (SC RFA), extended to 2070 and with an additional high growth scenario. This website documents the scpopulation R-package and provides access to the data for the general public without requiring the use of R software.

This package was developed and is maintained by Dr. Charles Alex Pellett, while working at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SC DNR) and subsequently the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SC DES). This information is for research and long-term water planning. None of the above guarantees the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of this information. The SC RFA, SC DNR, SC DES, and Dr. Pellett are NOT liable for any loss or damage arising from the use of this information.

As an R-package, `scpopulation` can be installed in an R terminal with the following code:

```{r eval=F}
# install.packages('devtools') 
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/capellett/scpopulation')
```
