<p>Two editions, or “vintages,” of the SC RFA projections are included
in this package, 2019 and 2022. Both editions have been used as inputs
to the River Basin Plans which have been developed in South Carolina
over this time. Each edition of the RFA projections includes a single
scenario which extends 15 years. For the purpose of long-term water
planning, the projections are extended to 2070, and an additional
scenario of high population growth has been developed. The graphs below
illustrate both editions of the results, at a state-wide level and for
several example counties.</p>
<p><img src="intro_files/figure-html/plots-1.png" width="700">
For each edition of the RFA projections, the RFA population numbers are
represented by the “Moderate” scenario. The Moderate scenario is
intended to represent a probable scenario of moderate growth. The “High”
scenario is intended to represent a plausible, but unlikely, scenario of
high growth. It is an extrapolation based on simple methods. Overall,
the population of South Carolina is projected to continue growing, but
the more recent projections are generally lower than the earlier
edition.</p>
<p>Horry county is an example of a rapidly growing population which is
no longer projected to grow as rapidly. The difference is most clear in
the High scenario. Stakeholders in the Pee Dee basin noted that the
earlier edition of the High scenario in Horry county seemed
unrealistically high, and the updated edition seemed more realistic.</p>
<p>Spartanburg county is an example of a rapidly growing county which is
now projected to grow even faster. Stakeholders in the Broad basin had
commented on the earlier edition of the projections that the High
population scenario seemed more realistic than the Moderate population
scenario in Spartanburg county. The updated projections appear to align
more closely with their expectations.</p>
<p>Allendale county is an example of a shrinking population. For the
purposes of long-term planning for water availability at a basin-wide
scale, it is generally important to plan for growth. In the High
scenario, all counties grow at least 10% faster than the statewide
average projected by SC RFA. In the Moderate scenario, declining
populations are projected to stabilize at the end of the SC RFA
projection period.</p>
<p>The SC RFA publishes their population projections approximately a
year after the population data is released (by the US Census). Thus, the
“vintage” of the data precedes the year of publication.</p>
