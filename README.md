# scpopulation

## An R-package containing population projections for the state of South Carolina.

`scpopulation` is an open-source R-package published as a repository on
GitHub. The package stores county level population data and projections
from the South Carolina Office of Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (SC RFA),
extended to 2070 and with an additional high growth scenario. The
population projection scenarios presented here have been used for water
availability planning in SC. This website documents the scpopulation
R-package and provides access to the data for the general public without
requiring the use of R software.

This package was developed by Dr. Charles Alex Pellett, while working at
the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SC DNR) and
subsequently the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SC
DES). This information is intended for research and long-term water
planning. None of the above guarantees the accuracy, reliability, or
completeness of this information. The SC RFA, SC DNR, SC DES, and
Dr. Pellett are NOT liable for any loss or damage arising from the use
of this information.

More information on the SC RFA projections is available on their
website:

More information on the South Carolina Water Plan is available on the SC
DES website:

The Introduction article provides an overview of the county population
projection data and shows some example graphs.

The Methods article includes metadata from the SC RFA and a detailed
description of the calculations for the extended projections and High
scenario.

The Results article (Work in Progress) includes graphical and tabular
results for all counties.

## Use in R

As an R-package, `scpopulation` can be installed in an R terminal with
the following code:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
