#' scpopulation: Population Projections data
#'
#' The SC Office of Revenue and Fiscal Affairs (RFA) publishes population Projections for each county in the state.
#' The RFA population Projections are stratified by gender and cohort.
#' The Projections were developed using the cohort-component method: rates of birth, death, migration are calculated for each gender-cohort
#' in each county; the calculated rates are then applied to the county populations to project future populations year by year.
#' The underlying assumption of this method is that the relevant demographic rates calculated from the calibration period will remain
#' uniform across the Projection period.
#' Two editions of the SC ORFA population Projections are reviewed and compared.
#' The earlier edition (November 2019) includes population Estimate from 2000 to 2018 and Projections from 2019 to 2035. The more recent edition (August 2022) includes Estimate from 2010 to 2020 and Projections from 2021 to 2038.
