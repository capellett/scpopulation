I downloaded these files from:

https://rfa.sc.gov/data-research/population-demographics/census-state-data-center/population-data/population-projections-2000-2035-rev2019

on October 15, 2023. 

I spot checked a few numbers, and they seem equal to the file I acquired about a year ago. Actually, my older file has more data (out to 2038 vs 2035).
